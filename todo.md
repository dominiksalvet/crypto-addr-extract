* `[x]` ignored extensions ignore letter case
* `[x]` use multithreading and thread-safe queue
* `[x]` use individual counters for threads
* `[x]` ignore custom directories (ignore letter case)
* `[x]` remove requirements.txt
* `[x]` file extension identification regexes are CONSTANTS
* `[ ]` break into multiple files
* `[x]` use streaming processing (progress is flawed), better memory usage
* `[ ]` crypto addresses are preferred in their order
